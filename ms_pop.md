> Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the
structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to
understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development
of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize
how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific
interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species
interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that
future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of
interaction networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that
there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related
to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards
population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our
predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact
over biogeographical scales.

# Introduction

Ecological interactions are the driving force behind ecological dynamics
within communities [@berlow_simple_2009]. Likely for this reason more than
any, the structure of communities have been described by species interaction
networks for over a century [@dunne_network_2006]. Formally an ecological
network is a mathematical and conceptual representation of both *species*,
and the *interactions* they establish. Behind this conceptual framework is
a rich and expanding literature whose primary focus has been to quantify how
numerical and statistical properties of networks relate to their robustness
[@dunne_network_2002], productivity [@duffy_functional_2007], or tolerance
to extinction [@memmott_tolerance_2004]. Although this approach classically
focused on food webs [@ings_ecological_2009], it has proved particularly
successful because it can be applied equally to all types of ecological
interactions [@kefi_more_2012].

This body of literature generally assumes that, short of changes in local
densities due to ecological dynamics, networks are inherently *static*
objects, which calls into question its relevance at biogeographic scales. More
explicitly, if two species are known to interact at one location, it is often
assumed that they will interact whenever and wherever they co-occur [see
*e.g.* @havens_scale_1992]; this neglects the fact that local environmental
conditions, species states, and community composition, can intervene in the
realization of interactions. More recently, however, it has been established
that networks are *dynamic* objects that have structured variation in $\alpha$,
$\beta$, and $\gamma$ diversity, not only to the change of species composition
at different locations but also to the fact that the same species will
interact in different ways over time or across their area of co-occurrence
[@poisot_dissimilarity_2012]. Of these sources of variation in networks,
the change of species composition has been addressed either explicitly
in the context of networks [@gravel_trophic_2011;@dattilo_spatial_2013],
or within classical meta-community theory. However, because this literature
mostly assumes that interactions happen consistently between species, it is
ill-suited to address network variation as a whole, and needs be supplemented
with new concepts and mechanisms.

Within the current paradigm, interactions are established between species,
and are an immutable "property" of a species pair. Starting from empirical
observations, expert knowledge, or literature surveys, one could collect
a list of interactions for any given species pool. Several studies used
this approach to extrapolate the structure of networks over time and space
[@havens_scale_1992;@piechnik_food-web_2008;@baiser_geographic_2012], by
considering that the network at *any* location is composed of *all* of the
potential interactions known for this species pool. This stands in stark
contrast with recent results showing that (i) the identities of interacting
species vary over space and (ii) the dissimilarity is not related to the
dissimilarity in species composition [@poisot_dissimilarity_2012]. The current
conceptual and operational tools to study networks leaves us poorly equipped to
understand the causes of this variation. In this paper, we propose a general
research agenda to understand the mechanisms involved in the variability of
species interactions.

In contrast to the current paradigm, we propose that future research on
interaction networks be guided by the following principles. First, at the
regional scale, species interactions are best represented as a stochastic
event. Second, the probability that two species will interact can be determined
as a function of traits and local abundances. Third, the local observations
of interactions can be viewed as the realization of a stochastic process,
of which it is possible to measure or infer the probability that it happens
at the regional level. This approach is outlined in **Box 1**. Although
this proposal is an intuitive yet radical change in the way we think about
ecological network structure, we demonstrate in this paper that it is well
supported by empirical and theoretical results alike. What is more, our new
perspective is well placed to open the door to novel predictive approaches
integrating a range of key ecological mechanisms. Notably, we propose in
**Box 2** that this approach facilitates the study of indirect interactions,
for which predictive approaches have long proved elusive [@tack_can_2011].

In a time where the next generation of predictive biogeographic models
will need to account for species interactions [@thuiller_road_2013], it is
crucial not to underestimate the fact that these interactions are not only
ill described as constants, but are ecological objects with a geographic
variability of their own. Indeed, investigating the impact of species
interactions on species distributions only makes sense under the implicit
assumption that species interactions themselves vary over biogeographical
scales. Models of species distributions will therefore increase their
predictive potential if they account for the variability of ecological
interactions. In turn, tighter coupling between species distributions and
interactions distributions models will allow accurate predictions of the
properties of emerging ecosystems [@gilman_framework_2010, @estes_trophic_2011]
and the spatial variability of properties between existing ecosystems. By
paying more attention to the variability of species interactions, the field
of biogeography will be able to re-visit classical observations typically
explained by species-level mechanisms: how does community complexity and
function vary along latitudinal gradients, is there information hidden in
the co-occurrence or avoidance of species interactions, etc.

In this paper, we outline the mechanisms that are involved in the variability
of species interactions over time, space, and environmental gradients. We
discuss how they will affect the structure of ecological networks, and
how these mechanisms can be integrated into new predictive and statistical
models (**Box 1**). Most importantly, we show that this approach integrates
classical community ecology thinking and biogeographic questions (**Box 2**),
and will ultimately result in a better understanding of the structure of
ecological communities.

# The dynamic nature of ecological interaction networks

Recent studies on the sensitivity of network structure to
environmental change provide some context for the study of dynamic
networks. @menke_plant-frugivore_2012 showed that the structure of a
plant–frugivore network changed along a forest–farmland gradient. At
the edges between two habitats, species were on average less specialized
and interacted more evenly with a larger number of partners than they did in
habitat cores. Differences in network structure have also been observed within
forest strata that differ in their proximity to the canopy and visitation
by birds [@schleuning_specialization_2011]. @tylianakis_habitat_2007
reports a *stronger* signal of spatial interaction turnover when working
with quantitative rather than binary interactions, highlighting the
importance of *measuring* rather than assuming the existence of interactions.
@eveleigh_fluctuations_2007 demonstrated that outbreaks of the spruce budworm
were associated to changes in the structure of its trophic network, both in
terms of species observed and their interactions. @poisot_resource_2011 used a
microbial system of hosts and pathogens to study the impact of productivity
gradients on realized infection; when the species were moved from high
to medium to low productivity, some interactions were lost and others were
gained. As a whole, these results suggest that the existence, and properties,
of an interaction are not only contingent on the presence of the two species
involved, but may also require particular environmental conditions, including
the presence or absence of species not directly involved in the interaction.

[f:meta]: figures/fig_proba.pdf "The metaweb concept"
![An illustration of the metaweb concept. In its simplest form, a metaweb is the list of all possible species and interactions between them for the system being studied, at the regional level (far left side). Everything that is ultimately observed in nature is a *realisation* of the metaweb (far right side), *i.e.* the resulting network after several sorting processes have occurred (central panel). First, species and species pairs have different probabilities to be observed (top panels). Second, as a consequence of the mechanisms we outline in this paper, not all interactions have the same probability to occur at any given site (bottom panels, see **Box 1**).\label{f:meta}][f:meta]

We argue here that there are three broadly-defined classes of mechanisms
that ultimately determine the realization of species interactions. First,
individuals must be in high enough local relative abundances to meet; this
is the so-called "neutral" perspective of interactions. Second, there must
be phenological matching between individuals, such that an interaction will
actually occur given that the encounter takes place. Finally, the realization
of an interaction is regulated by the interacting organisms' surroundings,
and should be studied in the context of indirect interactions. Below, we
examine each of these mechanisms in turn, and we show how they integrate into
a robust statistical framework in **Box 1**, and more broadly into a network
context in **Box 2**. We propose that shifting our approach from the species
level to the population level will result in a better appreciation of the
mechanisms of network variations, which will allow to develop mechanistic
hypotheses for the comparison of community structure in space, time, or over
environmental gradients.

# Population dynamics and neutral processes

Over the recent years, the concept of neutral dynamics has left a clear imprint
on the analysis of ecological network structure, most notably in bipartite
networks [@bluthgen_measuring_2006]. Re-analysis of several host–parasite
datasets, for example, showed that changes in local species abundances
triggers variation in parasite specificity [@vazquez_species_2005]. More
generally, it is possible to predict the structure of trophic interactions
given minimal assumptions about the distribution of species abundance
[@canard_emergence_2012]. In this section, we review recent studies
investigating the consequences of neutral dynamics on the structure of
interaction networks and show how variations in population size can lead
directly to interaction turnover.

## The basic processes

As noted previously, for an interaction to occur between individuals from two
populations, these individuals must first meet, then interact. Assuming that
two populations occupy the same location and are active at the same time of
the day/year, then the likelihood of an interaction is roughly proportional to
the product of their relative abundance [@vazquez_species_2007]. This means
that individuals from two large populations are more likely to interact than
individuals from two small populations, simply because they tend to meet more
often. This approach can also be extended to the prediction of interaction
strength [@bluthgen_measuring_2006;@vazquez_species_2007], *i.e.* how strong
the consequences of the interaction will be. The neutral perspective predicts
that locally-abundant species should have more partners, and locally-rare
species should appear more specialized. In a purely neutral model (*i.e.*
interactions happen entirely by chance, although the determinants of abundance
can still be non-neutral), the identities of species do not matter, and
it becomes easy to understand how this can lead to a situation where the
structure of local networks will vary since species vary regionally in
abundance. @canard_emergence_2012 proposed the term of "neutrally forbidden
links" to refer to interactions that are phenologically feasible but not
realized because of the underlying population size distribution. The identity
of these neutrally forbidden links will vary over time and space, either by
stochastic changes in population sizes or because population size responds
deterministically (i.e. non-neutrally) to extrinsic drivers.

## Benefits for network analysis

It is important to understand how local variations in abundance, whether
neutral or not, cascade up to affect the structure of interaction networks. One
approach is to use simple statistical models to quantify the effect of
population sizes on local interaction occurrence or strength [see *e.g.*
@krishna_neutral-niche_2008]. These models can be further extrapolated
to remove the contribution of neutrality to link strength, allowing us to
work directly on the interactions as they are determined by traits (**Box
1**). Doing so allows us to compare the variation of neutral and non-neutral
components of network structure over space and time. To achieve this goal,
however, it is essential the future sampling of interaction networks (i)
are replicated and (ii) include independent measurements of population sizes.

An additional benefit is that these data will also help refine neutral
theory. @wootton_field_2005 made the point that deviations of empirical
communities from neutral predictions were most often explained by species
trophic interactions, which are notoriously, albeit intentionally, absent
from the original formulation of the theory [@hubbell_unified_2001]. Merging
the two views will increase our explanatory power, and provide new ways to
test neutral theory in interactive communities. It will also offer a new
opportunity, namely to complete the integration of network structure with
population dynamics. To date, most studies focused on the consequence of
one species having a particular position within a food web on the dynamics
of its biomass or abundance [@brose_allometric_2006; @berlow_simple_2009;
@stouffer_compartmentalization_2011; @saavedra_strong_2011]. Adopting this
neutral perspective brings things full circle since the abundance of a
species will also dictate its position in the network: changes in abundance
can lead to interactions being gained or lost, and these changes in abundance
are in part caused by existing interactions (**Box 2**). For this reason,
there is a potential to link species and interaction dynamics and, more
importantly, to do so in a way which accounts for the interplay between the
two. From a practical point of view, this requires repeated sampling of a
system through time, so that changes in relative abundances can be related
to changes in interaction strength [@yeakel_probabilistic_2012]. Importantly,
embracing the neutral view will force us to reconsider the causal relationship
between resource dynamics and interaction strength; in a neutral context,
both are necessarily interdependent, a fact which likely further increases
the complexity of the feedbacks between them.

# Traits matching in space and time

Once individuals meet, whether they will interact is widely thought to be
the product of an array of behavioral, phenotypic, cultural aspects, that
can conveniently be referred to as a "trait-based process". Two populations
can interact when their traits values allow it, *e.g.* viruses are able to
overcome host resistance, predators can capture the preys, trees provide
enough shading for shorter grasses to grow. Non-matching traits will
effectively prevent the existence of an interaction, as demonstrated by
@olesen_missing_2011. Under this perspective, the existence of interactions
can be mapped onto trait values, and interaction networks will consequently
vary along with variation in local trait distribution. In this section,
we review how trait-based processes impact network structure, how they can
create variation, and the perspective they open for an evolutionary approach.

## The basic processes

There is considerable evidence that, at the species level, interaction partners
are selected on the grounds of matching trait values. Random networks built on
these rules exhibit realistic structural properties [@williams_simple_2000;
@stouffer_quantitative_2005]. Trait values, however, vary from population to
population within species, and so it is expected that the local interactions
will be contingent upon traits spatial distribution (\autoref{f:traits}). The
fact that the niche of a species can appear large if it is the aggregation
of narrow but differentiated individual or population niches is now well
established [@devictor_defining_2010;@bolnick_ecology_2003], and it has
also reinforced the need to understand intra-specific trait variation to
describe the structure and dynamics of communities [@woodward_ecological_2010;
@bolnick_why_2011]. Nevertheless, this notion has yet to percolate into the
literature on network structure, despite its most profound consequence: a
species appearing generalist at the regional scale can easily be specialized
in *each* of the patches it occupies. This reality has long been recognized
by functional ecologists, which are now increasingly predicting the *variance*
in traits of different populations within a species [@violle_return_2012].

Empirically, there are several examples of intraspecific trait variation
resulting in extreme interaction turnover. A particularly spectacular example
was identified by @ohba_field_2011 who describes how a giant waterbug
is able to get hold of, and eventually consume, juveniles from a turtle
species. This interaction can only happen when the turtle is small enough
for the morphotraits of the bug to allow to consume it, and as such will vary
throughout the developmental cycle of both species. @choh_predator-prey_2012
demonstrated through behavioral assays that preys which evaded predation
when young were more likely to predate juvenile predators than the "naive"
individuals; their past interactions shaped behavioral traits that alter the
network structure over time. These examples show that trait-based effects
on networks can be observed even in the absence of genotypic variation
(although we discuss this in the next section).

In the trait-based perspective, the existence of an interaction is
an emergent property of the trait distribution of local populations:
variations in one or both of these distributions, regardless of the mechanism
involved (development, selection, plasticity, environment), are likely
to alter the interaction. Importantly, when interaction-driving traits
are subject to environmental forcing (for example, body size is expected
to be lower in warm environments, @angilletta_temperature_2004), there
can be covariation between environmental conditions and the occurrence of
interactions. @woodward_climate_2012 demonstrate that changes in food-web
structure happen at the same time as changes in body mass in experimental
macrocosms. Integrating trait variation over spatial or temporal gradients is
a central concern at present if we are to understand, for example, network
variation and its subsequent response to environmental change.

[f:traits]: figures/fig_aggregation.pdf "Traits and populations"
![The left-hand side of this figure represents possible interactions between populations (circles) of four species (ellipses), and the aggregated species interaction network on the right. In this example, the populations and species level networks have divergent properties, and the inference on the system dynamics are likely to be different depending on the level of observation. More importantly, if the three populations highlighted in red were to co-occur, there would be no interactions between them, whereas the species-level network would predict a linear chain.\label{f:traits}.][f:traits]

## Benefits for network analysis

Linking spatial and temporal trait variation with network variation will help
identify the mechanistic basis of network dissimilarity. From a sampling point
of view, having enough data requires that, when interactions are recorded,
they are coupled with trait measurements. Importantly, these measurements
cannot merely be extracted from a reference database because interactions
are driven by *local* trait values and their matching across populations
from different species. Within our overarching statistical framework (**Box
1**), we expect that (i) network variability at the *regional* scale will be
dependent on the variation of population traits values, and (ii) variation
between any series of networks will depend on the *covariance* between species
traits. Although it requires considerably larger quantities of data to test,
this approach should allow us to infer *a priori* network variation. Given this
next generation of data will also help link variation of network structure to
variation of environmental conditions.  @price_macroevolutionary_2003 shows how
specific biomechanical responses to water input in shrubs can have pleiotropic
effects on traits involved in the interaction with insects. In their system,
the difference in network structure can be explained because (i) trait values
determine the existence of an interaction, and (ii) environmental features
determine trait values.  We have little doubt that future empirical studies
will provide similar mechanistic narratives.

At larger temporal scales, the current distribution of traits also reflects
past evolutionary history [@diniz-filho_macroecology_2008]. Recognizing
this important fact offers an opportunity to approach the evolutionary
dynamics and variation of networks. Correlations between traits of
different species, and between traits and fitness, drive coevolutionary
dynamics [@gomulkiewicz_hot_2000;@nuismer_coevolution_2003]. Both of
these vary over space and time [@thompson_geographic_2005], creating
patchiness in the processes and outcomes of coevolution. Trait
structure and trait correlations are also disrupted by migration
[@gandon_host-parasite_2008;@burdon_coevolution_2009]. Ultimately,
understanding of how ecological and evolutionary trait dynamics affect network
structure will provide a mechanistic basis to the historical signal found in
contemporary network structures [@rezende_non-random_2007; @eklof_relevance_2011;
@baskerville_spatial_2011; @stouffer_evolutionary_2012].

# Beyond direct interactions

In this section, we argue that, although networks are built around observations
of direct interactions like predation or pollination, they also offer a
compelling tool with which to address indirect effects on the existence and
strength of interactions. Any direct interaction arises from the "physical"
interaction of only two species, and, as we have already detailed, these can
be modified by local relative abundances and/or species traits.  Indirect
interactions, on the other hand, are established through the involvement
of another party than the two focal species, either through cascading
effects (herbivorous species compete with insect laying eggs on plants) or
through physical mediation of the environment (bacterial exudates increase
the bio-availability of iron for all bacterial species; plants with large
foliage provide shade for smaller species).  As we discuss in this section,
the fact that many (if not all) interactions are indirectly affected by the
presence of other species (i) has relevance for understanding the variation
of interaction network structure and (ii) can be studied within the classical
network-theory formalism.

## The basic processes

Several authors (see @golubski_modifying_2011 and references therein) have
demonstrated that biotic interactions themselves interact, or in other words
are contingent on the occurrence of other species. Because the outcome of
an interaction ultimately affects local abundances (on ecological times)
and population trait structure (over evolutionary times), all interactions
happening within a community will impact one another. This does not actually
mean pairwise approaches are bound to fail, but it does hearken for a
larger scale approach that accounts for indirect effects.

The occurrence or absence of a biotic interaction can either affect either
the realization of other interactions (thus affecting the "interaction"
component of network $\beta$-diversity) or the presence of other species.
There are several well-documented examples of one interaction allowing
new interactions to happen (e.g. opportunistic pathogens have a greater
success of infection on hosts which are already immunocompromised by
previous infections @olivier_are_2012), or conversely preventing them (a
resident symbiont decreases the infection probability of a new pathogen
[@koch_socially_2011;@heil_protective_2003]). In both cases, the driver
of interaction turnover is the patchiness of species distribution;
the species acting as a "modifier" of the interaction is only partially
present throughout the range of the other two species, thus creating a
mosaic of different interaction configurations. Variation in interaction
structure can happen through both cascading and environmental effects:
@singer_disentangling_2004 show that caterpillars change the proportion
of different plant species in their diet, favoring low quality items to
load on chemical compounds which are toxic for their parasitoids. However,
low quality food results in birds having a greater impact on caterpillar
populations [@singer_tritrophic_2012]. It is noteworthy that in this example,
the existence of an interaction will affect both the strength, and impact, of
other interactions. In terms of their effects on network $\beta$-diversity,
indirect effects are thus likely to act on components of dissimilarity. A
common feature of the examples mentioned here is that pinpointing the exact
mechanism through which species interactions interfere often requires a good
working knowledge of the system's natural history.

## Benefits for network analysis

Better understanding why and where species interact will provide a mechanistic
understanding of observed species co-occurrences. However, the presence
of species is also regulated by indirect interactions. Recent experimental
work by @sanders_indirect_2012 showed that some predator species can only be
maintained if another predator species is present, since the latter regulates
a competitively superior prey and allows for prey coexistence. These effects
involving several species and several types of interactions across trophic
levels are complex (and for this reason, have been deemed unpredictable in the
past, @tack_can_2011), and can only be understood by comparing communities in
which different species are present/absent. Looking at figure \ref{f:meta},
it is also clear that the probability of having an interaction between
species $i$ and $j$ ($\text{P}(\mathbf{L}_{ij})$) is ultimately constrained
by the probability of simultaneously observing $i$ and $j$ together, *i.e.*
$\text{P}(i \cap j)$. Thus, the existence of any ecological interaction will
be contingent upon *other* ecological interactions driving local co-occurrence
[@araujo_using_2011]. Based on this argument, ecological networks cannot be
limited to a collection of pairwise interactions. Our view of them needs
be updated to account for the importance of the context surrounding these
interactions (**Box 2**). From a biogeographic standpoint, it requires us to
develop a theory based on interaction co-occurrence in addition to the current
knowledge encompassing only species co-occurrence. @araujo_using_2011 and
@allesina_competitive_2011 introduced the idea that competitive interactions
can leave a trace in species co-occurrence network. A direct consequence
of this result is that, for example, trophic interactions are constrained
by species' competitive outcomes *before* they are ever constrained by
predation-related traits. So as to fully understand interactions and their
indirect effects, however, there is a need to develop new conceptual tools
to *represent* effects that interactions have on one another. In a graph
theoretical perspective, this would amount to establishing edges between
pairs of edges, a task for which there is no conceptual or methodological
background yet.

# Conclusions

Overall, we argue here that the notion of “species interaction networks”
shifts our focus away from the level of organization at which most of the
relevant biogeographic processes happen --- populations. In order to make
reliable predictions on the structure of networks, we need to understand
what triggers variability of ecological interactions. In this contribution,
we outlined that there are several direct (abundance-based and trait-based)
and indirect (biotic modifiers, indirect effects of co-occurrence) effects to
account for. We expect that the relative importance of each of these factors,
and how precisely they affect the probability of establishing an interaction,
are likely system-specific; nonetheless, we have proposed a unified conceptual
approach to understand them better.

At the moment, the field of community ecology is severely data-limited to
tackle this perspective. Despite the existence of several spatially- or
temporally-replicated datasets [*e.g.* @schleuning_specialization_2011 ;
@schleuning_specialization_2012 ; @menke_plant-frugivore_2012], it is rare
that all relevant information has been measured independently. It was recently
concluded, however, that even a reasonably small subset of data can be enough
to draw inferences at larger scales [@gravel_inferring_2013]. Paradoxically,
as tempting as it may be to sample a network in its entirety, the
goal of establishing global predictions might be better furthered by
extremely-detailed characterization of a more modest number of interactions
[@rodriguez-cabal_node-by-node_2013]. Assuming that there are indeed statistical
invariants in the rules governing interactions, this information will allow us
to make verifiable predictions on the structure of the networks. Better still,
this approach has the potential to substantially strengthen our understanding
of the interplay between traits and neutral effects. @bluthgen_what_2008 claim
that the impact of traits distribution on network structure can be inferred
simply by removing the impact of neutrality (population densities), based
on the idea that many rare links were instances of sampling artifacts. As
illustrated here (e.g, **Box 2**), their approach is of limited generality,
as the abundance of a species itself can be directly driven by factors such
as trait-environment matching.

With the accumulation of data, these approaches will rapidly expand our ability
to predict the re-wiring of networks under environmental change. The effect of
environmental change is expected to occur because (i) population sizes will
be affected by the change and (ii) either plastic or adaptive responses will
shift or disrupt the trait distributions. The framework proposed in **Box 1**
predicts interaction probabilities under different scenarios. Ultimately, being
explicit about the trait-abundance-interaction feedback will provide a better
understanding of short-term and long-term dynamics of interaction networks. We
illustrate this in Fig. \ref{f:synth}. The notion that population sizes have
direct effects on the existence of an interaction stands opposed to classical
consumer-resource theory, which is one of the bases of network analysis.
Considering this an opposition, however, is erroneous. Consumer-resource
theory considers a strong effect of abundance on the intensity of interactions
(**Box 2**), and itself is a source of (quantitative) variation. Furthermore,
these models are entirely determined by variations in population sizes in
the limiting case where the coefficient of interactions are similar. As
such, any approach seeking to understand the variation of interactions over
space ought to consider that local densities are not only a consequence,
but also a predictor, of the probability of observing an interaction. The
same reasoning can be held for local trait distributions, although over
micro-evolutionary time-scales. While traits values determine whether two
species are able to interact, they will be modified by the selective effect
of species interacting. Therefore, conceptualizing interactions as the
outcome of a probabilistic proccess regulated by local factors, as opposed
to a constant, offers the unprecedented opportunity to investigate feedbacks
between different time scales.

[f:synth]: figures/fig_synth.pdf "Synthesis"
![The approcach we propose (that populations can interact at the conditions that **1** their trait allow it and **2** they are locally abundant enough to meet) requires to shift our focus to population-level processes. A compelling argument to work at this level of organisation is that eco-evolutionary feedbacks explicit. All of the components of interaction variability we described are potentially related, either through variations of population sizes due to the interaction, or due to selection stemming from these variations in population size. In addition, some traits involved in the existence of the interaction may also affect local population abundance. \label{f:synth}.][f:synth]

Over the past decade, much insights were gained in looking at the turnover
of different facets of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic)
through space [@meynard_beyond_2011, @devictor_spatial_2010]. Here, we propose
that there is an oft-neglected side of biodiversity: species interactions. The
perspective we bring forth allows us to unify these dimensions and offers
us the opportunity to describe the biogeographic structure of all components
of community and ecosystem structure simultaneously.

**Box 1: A mathematical framework for population-level interactions**

In this contribution, we propose that the occurrence
(and intensity) of ecological interactions at the population level relies on several factors, including
relative local abundances and local trait distributions. It is important to
tease apart these different factors, so as to better disentangle neutral and
niche processes. We propose that these different effects can adequately be
partitioned using the model

$$\mathbf{A}_{ij} \propto \left[\mathcal{N}(i,j)\times\mathcal{T}(i,j)\right]+\epsilon \,,$$

where $\mathcal{N}$ is a function giving the probability that species $i$
and $j$ interact *based on their relative abundances*, and $\mathcal{T}$
is a function giving the *per encounter* probability that species $i$
and $j$ interact *based on their trait values*. The term $\epsilon$
accounts for all higher-order effects, such as indirect interactions,
local impact of environmental conditions on the interaction, and impact of
co-occurring species. Both of these functions can take any form needed. In
several papers, $\mathcal{N}(i,j)$ was expressed as $\mathbf{n}_i\times
\mathbf{n}_j$, where $\mathbf{n}$ is a vector of relative abudances
[@canard_emergence_2012;@vazquez_species_2007]. The expression of
$\mathcal{T}$ can in most cases be derived from mechanistic hypotheses
about the observation. For example, @gravel_inferring_2013 used the niche
model of @williams_simple_2000 to draw interactions, with the simple rule
that $\mathcal{T}(i,j) = 1$ if $i$ can consume $j$ based on allometric
rules, and $0$ otherwise. Following @rohr_modeling_2010, the expression of
$\mathcal{T}$ can be based on latent variables rather than actual trait
values. This simple formulation could be used to partition, at the level
of individual interactions, the relative importance of density-dependent
and trait-based processes using variance decomposition. Most importantly,
it predicts (i) how each of these components will vary over space and (ii)
how the structure of the network will be affected by, for example, changes
in local abundances or trait distributions.

This model can further be extended in a spatial context, as

$$\mathbf{A}_{ijx} \propto \left[\mathcal{N}_x(i_x,j_x)\times\mathcal{T}_x(i_x,j_x)\right]+\epsilon_{ijx} \,,$$

in which $i_x$ is the population of species $i$ at site $x$. In this
formulation, the $\epsilon$ term could include the spatial variation of
interaction between $i$ and $j$ over sites, and the covariance between the
observed presence of this interaction and the occurrence of species $i$ and
$j$. This can, for example, help adress situations in which the selection
of prey items is determined by traits, but also by behavioral choices. Most
importantly, this model differs in that each site $x$ is characterized by a
set of functions ${\mathcal{N}_x, \mathcal{T}_x}$, that may not be identical
for all sites considered. For example, the same predator can prefer different
prey items in different locations, which will require the use of a different
shape for $\mathcal{T}$ across the range of locations. @gravel_inferring_2013
show that it is possible to derive robust approximation for the $\mathcal{T}$
function even with incomplete set of data, which gives hopes that this
framework can be applied even when all species information are not known
at all sites (which would be an unrealistic requirement for most realistic
systems). Both of these models can be used to partition the variance from
existing data, or to test which trait-matching function best describes the
observed interactions. They also provide a solid platform for dynamical
simulations in that they will allow re-wiring the interaction network as
a function of trait change and to generate simulations that are explicit about
the variability of interactions.

**Box 2: Population-level interactions in the classical modelling framework**

As noted in the main text, most studies of ecological networks---particularly
food webs---regard the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ as a fixed entity
that specifies observable interactions on the basis of whether two species
co-occur or not. Given this assumption, there is a lengthy history of trying to
understand how the strength or organization of these interactions influence
the dynamic behavior of species abundance [@may_stability_1973]. Often,
such models take the form

$$\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = N_i(t) \left(a_i - \sum_{j \ne i} \alpha_{ij} A_{ij} N_j(t) \right) \,,$$

where $a_i$ is the growth rate of species $i$ (and could, in principle,
depend on other species' abundances $N$) and $\alpha_{ij}$ is the strength
of the effect of $j$ on $i$.  In this or just about any related model,
direct species-species interaction can influence species abundances but their
abundances *never* feedback and influence the *per capita* interaction coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$. They
do, however, affect the realized interactions, which are defined by
$\alpha_{ij} N_i(t) N_j(t)$, something which is also the case when considering
more complicated functional responses [@koen-alonso_process-oriented_2007].

More recently, there have been multiple attempts to approach the problem from
the other way around. Namely, to understand how factors such as species'
abundance and/or trait distributions influence the occurrence of the
interactions themselves (**Box 1**). One potential drawback to that approach,
however, is that it still adopts the assumption that the observation of
any interaction $A_{ij}$ is only an explicit function of the properties of
species $i$ and $j$ (traits and co-occurrence).

Since dynamic models can demonstrate quite clearly that non-interacting
species can alter each others' abundances (e.g. via apparent competition
[@bonsall_parasitoid-mediated_1999]), this is a deeply-ingrained inconsistency between
the two approaches. Such a simplification does increase the analytical
tractability of the problem [@allesina_stability_2012], but there is little,
if any, guarantee that it is ecologically accurate. In our opinion, the
"higher-effects" term $\epsilon$ in the models presented in **Box 1** is
the one with the least straightforward expectations, but it may also prove
to be the most important if we wish to accurately describe all of these
indirect effects.

A similar problem actually arises in the typical statistical framework
for predicting interaction occurrence. Often, one attempts to "decompose"
interactions into the component that is explained by species' abundances and
the component explained by species' traits (e.g., Box 1). Just like how the
underlying functions $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ could vary across sites,
there should also be feedback between species' abundances and traits, in the
same way that we have outlined the feedback between interactions and species'
abundances. In fact, given the increasing evidence for the evolutionary role
of species-species interactions in explaining extant biodiversity and their
underlying traits [@janzen_neotropical_1982; @herrera_interaction_2002],
a framework which assumes relative independence of these different phenomenon
is likely starting from an overly-simplified perspective.
