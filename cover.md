Dear Pr. Bronte,   

On behalf of my co-authors, Dominique Gravel and Daniel B. Stouffer, I
would like to submit the attached manuscript for publication consideration
as a "Forum" in *Oïkos*.

There is widespread acceptance that an ecological community consists of
species *and* their interactions. Despite this fact, most  research on the
variation of ecological communities focuses exclusively on variation of the
local species pool, implying that much of mainstream community ecology is in
fact disconnected from its most basic definition. At best, species
interactions are treated as a covariate; at worst, they are neglected
entirely. In our manuscript, we argue that this stems from a lack of awareness
and recognition of the mechanisms that drive variation of species interactions
through space and time.

In this contribution, we classify these mechanisms in three large families:
effects of local abundances, effects of local species' trait distributions,
and finally indirect effects of interactions. We propose that studies of the
variation of community structure should draw explicitly on these mechanisms.
Moreover, we show that (i) it is possible to integrate multiples sources of
variation in ecological interactions into a cohesive, spatially-explicit
statistical framework, and (ii) the approach we propose is not disconnected
from current paradigms in community ecology but instead represents an attempt
to integrate important yet neglected mechanisms.

As outlined by *Oïkos*, the description of the "Forum" section mentions that
articles should strive to "*transgress existing boundaries by synthesizing
larger fields or seemingly disparate areas, and to offer new ways of
interpreting existing data*". We are confident that our contribution fits this
bill perfectly since we propose to
**DBS: I think the following is a bit too wordy and somewhat nebulous**
direct research towards novel statistical approaches that draw from a
synthesis of different families of mechanisms.

We hope that this submission will be viewed favorably by the editorial board,   

On behalf of the authors,   
T. Poisot
