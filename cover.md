Dear Pr. Bronte,   

On behalf of my co-authors, Dominique Gravel and Daniel B. Stouffer, I
would like to submit the attached manuscript for publication consideration
as a "forum" in *OÃ¯kos*.

Despite several decades of fundamental advances, research in community ecology
is still largely disconnected from the definition of an ecological community:
species and their interactions. Most of the research on the variation of
ecological communities focuses only on the variation of the local species
pool. At best, species interactions are treated as a covariate, and at worst
(and with alarming frequency), they are neglected entirely. We think that this
stems from a lack of awareness on the mechanisms involved in the variation
of species interactions through space and time.

In this contribution, we classify these mechanisms in three large families:
effects of local abundances, effects of local species trait distributions,
and finally indirect effects of interactions. We propose that studies
of the variation of community structure should draw explicitely on these
mechanisms. We show that (i) it is possible to integrate the sources of
variations of ecological interactions into a cohesive, spatially explicit
statistical framework, and (ii) the approach we propose is not disconnected
from current paradigms in community ecology, but represents an extensions
seeking to integrate important yet neglected mechanisms.

The description of the "Forum" section mentions that these articles should
strive to "*transgress existing boundaries by synthesizing larger fields or
seemingly disparate areas, and to offer new ways of interpreting existing
data*". We believe that our contribution fits this bill perfectly, as we
propose to orient research towards new statistical approached, inspired from
a synthesis of different families of mechanisms.

We hope that this submission will be viewed favorably by the editorial board,   

On behalf of the authors,   
T. Poisot
