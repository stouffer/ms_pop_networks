Dear Pr. Currie,

We would like to submit the following manuscript entitled *Beyond species:
why ecological interactions vary through space and time*, authored by myself,
Daniel B Stouffer, and Dominique Gravel, for publication consideration as
a *Research Review* in *Global Ecology and Biogeography*.

Accounting for biotic interactions in predictive models of species
distributions is a pressing issue in biogeography. Yet, as we argue in
this paper, our current view of species interactions is poorly suited
to this task. Most of the conceptual tools stem from the notion that
biotic interactions can be represented by a network of interactions between
species. This, howver, fails to adress that interactions between species vary
locally, as a function of population densities, local trait distributions,
and indirect interactions between co-occuring species.

In this contribution, we (i) review the ecological mechanisms involved in the
variability of species interactions and (ii) explain how accounting for this
variability will allow more informative predictions of species interactions
in space. The most significant contribution of our article is that, so as to
make good use of species interactions in a biogeographic context, we need to
shift our attention (i) from species to populations-level proccesses, and (ii)
from interactions as a constant to probabilistic models of network structure.

We are convinced that our paper is highly novel, and will be an important
contribution to the ongoing discussion about merging ecological interactions
in biogeographical studies.

We declare no conflicts of interest. This manuscript has first been published
as a preprint on *biORxiV* (doi: 10.1101/001677).

We hope that our contribution is suitable for *Global Ecology and Biogeography*,

Best regards,   
On behalf of the authors,   
   
Timoth√©e Poisot
